Campfire Coffee Practice

This project is a second attempt for practice with the concepts learned in Code Fellows Code 201. There is already an existing repository named campfire-coffee in my GitHub profile with this exact same project.  

I will be changing some of aspects such as the data to make this project slightly different but as a whole the same in principle.
